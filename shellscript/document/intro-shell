# introduction of shellscript`


Shell Sccript :
	what is shell script?
	A unix shell program interprets user commands which are directly entered by the user or which 
	can be read from a file called the shell script or sheell program.

	note: its interprets the shell scripts butnot compiling 

	Bash Scripting: 
		/cat/shells - u can see diff types of shell which your system can suppport.
			sh 	    - sh stands for bourne shell which is original shell stiil used in unix env
                	bash        - bash stands for bourne again shell was reinvented, which is standard and felxible.

		which bash	    	= where bash located.
		touch filename      	- creating file with an exetension .sh
		ls -la 			- it will displays  the list of the files and directoriees indetailed

	starting script language
		#!			- #!(hashbang) adding location, this helps to know interpreter that it is shell script /1st line is standard practise to use 	
		echo "content"		-  using echo code it will print the content which is display in the double quotes
		./filename		- ./filename will execute the code which is written in the file.

	-bash: ./file name: Permission denied
		 to know why permission denied  by using code "ls -la or ls -ltr"  we can identified 
	 				-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 71 Mar  2 10:16 hello.sh
					user	groupi	other
					r - 4	r - 4	r - 4 -----------
					w - 2	w - 2	w - 2           |===> 777 (r = reading permission / w = writing permission / x = executiving permission) 
					x - 1	x - 1	x - 1 -----------	
					if it is permission denied it will be null (-) so in this file executing permission is denied
					for giving permission we will use the code  "chmod u+x g+x o+x / 755 filename"
	comment and variables
		comments : line of code which is not executable by the code which will helpful information to know about the scripts for the other user
		 # 			-  is used for comment before content
		variables 		- variables are the container which stores data inside in them it can be string, number
					- in shell there are two kinds of variables they are system variables and ther one user defined variables
					System variables :
						created and maintained by unix or linux operating system. these are predefined variables. these are the variables are defiened in capital cases.
						echo $BASH
						echo $BASH_VERSION
						echo $HOME
						echo $PWD
					user variables :
						created and maintained by user. defined in lowercases 			
						 by giving a name = name of the variable
						 name = sathyapriya
						 echo my lovely name is $name 
		 
		note : in variable, variable name should not start from number
